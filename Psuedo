Have a start page with a start button. Upon clicking, hide start div or overwrite the div w/ new JS (question)
Start interval 
Write question and answers to div, questions can be written as strings, answers will be kept in an array
user can chose an answer within time frame, on click, andvance to the next question. If user does not click before time ends, then move to the next.

4 vars-- userGuess, correctAnswer, wrongAnswer, noAnswer
